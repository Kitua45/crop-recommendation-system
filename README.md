# crop-recommendation-system

This project is a smart crop recommendation system built using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrient levels (N, P, K) to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation. The goal is to assist farmers in making informed decisions to improve crop yield and promote sustainable agriculture.
